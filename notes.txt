Steps:
- Before connection:
    - Server must be running as a process
    - server must have a special socket for initial contact from a client process on some arbitrary host (serversocket)
- Create a TCP socket in the client program
    - this socket specifies IP of server host and port num of socket
- client initiates 3-way handshake -> takes place in transport layer
- when server hears the doorknock -> creates a new socket for this client (connectionsocket)
-
